# About Me
I took both CS3217 and CS3281 in AY21/22 Semester 2 as a year 2 CS student. The following fact and comments are just my personal view on the 2 modules. Things may be different in the past / change in future. You or other people might have different experiences based on your team / background.

# CS3217

## Class Stats
A total of 78 students applied and the max intake was 40. In the end, we had 36 students in the class. This year's median CAP is 4.64.

I think around 50% are year 2s, 30% are year 3s and 20% year 4s. I might be wrong but that is my estimate. I think half of the year 2s were from CVWO. (I am not.)

## Schedule
Similar to CS2103/T, for the first half of the semester, we did a series of Problem Sets. We focused on building an game called [Peggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggle) for iPad. For the second half, groups of 4 were formed and you can propose any project that you want to do. A pitching party was held on week 6. (I might be wrong.) This was the time that everyone share their app ideas. After that the team is formed and we work on our proposed project.

For the first half of the semester, lectures were held twice (1 and 2 hours) a week. Lectures were NOT recorded. Lectures focus on SWE things and some cool things about Swift. I stopped going after 3 weeks. Tutorials were held once every 2 weeks. We mainly discussed on the problem sets as well as some software engineering topics.

For the second half of the semester, we had no lectures and tutorials. Each team was supposed to meet the prof once every 2 weeks to update progress and show the work.

## Problem Sets
For me, I had never done any iOS development before this mod, learning everything from the start was really not easy. You also have to code in Swift which is a little different from the languages that I was familiar with. To be honest, learning Swift was not too bad.

For the first Problem Set 0, we just need to solve some relatively simple algo problem using Swift. I guess it was for us to get familiar with Swift. Not much to elaborate here. Probably will vary from year to year.

The following Problem Sets were the most painful part of the module for sure. It just felt overwhelming when you see the instructions. Each set is a 2 week iteration. You can check out the [page](https://cs3217.github.io/cs3217-docs/problem-sets/problem-set-0) for more details. As I do not really know anyone in class, I soloed the entire process and it was not fun.

Simply put, you really need to have a clear plan from the very beginning. The teaching teams changed the requirement to purposely mess you up. If you planned things well, you will have a much easier time. This includes making the system extensible, no hard coded lines and more.

Did I learn from my painful lessons? Absolutely! Was it fun? Hell no!

Tips: start early, think more before you start coding. 

## Team Project
I was very lucky to have a really good group. I am really really grateful about it. I worked with 2 year 4s and 1 year 3. All of them are really smart and they were very helpful too.

I will not go into the details of my project. All you need to know is that the prof looks for good SWE elements in your project. Therefore, the feature itself is not important. You can clone an existing app if you want.

The grading of the team project was actually done individually. However, I personally think that there is a group component to it. Maybe on the overall design or how well the features work together. That is just my guess. During each meeting, each member is supposed to present on their part. The prof will give feedbacks and ask questions. The grade should be given based on what he observed during the meeting I guess. 

For team project, do try to think of something that you think is a good demonstration of your SWE skills. For my first meeting, I worked on the UI which I thought was really complex for our project. However, the prof thought it was not hard enough. That was partially true because there was almost no design pattern/clever implementation of code. The hard part came with dealing with SwiftUI. After that meeting, I came up with a system that allows the addition of new features easily without modifying most of the existing code. I think he liked it. (Hopefully)

## Overall Comment
I really hated the module at first. Every week was a pain doing the Problem Sets. There were multiple times when I opened EduRec and wanted to drop the module. But I am glad that I survived and became a much better SWE.

You are working with some of the smartest people in SoC. Team project should be a pleasant experience for everyone. The workload in the second half was significantly lower than the first half. 

Finally, always start early and plan before coding!!!

## Tips
If you do not own a Mac, I will not recommend taking this module. The Problem Sets need to be done as an iOS app. You can only do native iOS development on Macs. For team project, while you can do android apps using Kotlin, the classes do not teach any of that so you need to learn it yourself. Cross platform (Flutter/React Native) are not allowed if you are thinking about it.

You should start coding in swift and do some simple projects during the holiday. You can even start the Peggle project earlier I guess. The Peggle game has been the same for the past few years. Do note that the detailed requirement changes from year to year. The  Do expect to spend A LOT of time on this module. It is like 3-4 times more than CS2103/T.

# CS3281
## Class Stats
We had a total of 18 students this year. The prof said that it was about 3-4 applicant for each position. I believe this module is harder to get in as compared to CS3217. Nothing was mentioned on the CAP of the students. I do know that many students with 4.8-5.0 CAP were rejected. CAP is not the only thing that matters in the selection process.

## Structure
Known as the OSS module, this module is very straightforward. Open issues, discuss issues, create PRs, close issues, review PRs... 

You will be given a project to work on. I worked on RepoSense. The list of project and details of the module can be found [here](https://nus-cs3281.github.io/website/).

For the first 3 week, you are expected to get familiar with the code. Maybe work on issues that are easier for beginners. For the next 3 week, you should start pushing out more PRs. For the rest of the semester, you are expected to keep up the standard and start reviewing each other's PRs. The workload curve is rather flat throughout the semester.

We had lectures for the first 3 weeks. But it was mainly just some very general advice on working with OSS projects. Each team also did a small presentation on the project. I think the main goal was to get everyone to know what is the project that they are actually working on.

There were no lectures after the 3rd week. From there onwards, each team meets the prof during the lecture time to update progress, sound out any difficulties and maybe some simple discussions. As the lecture was on Monday, I always spend my Sunday night thinking what have I done for that week...

All of your work and progress will have to be documented for prof to evaluate and give the final grade. The focus here is not just the number of PRs, but the quality too. This includes discussions, considerations and trade-offs, as well as code quality and documentation. Do not worry if you think you are pushing out less work than other people. As long as you can justify why it took longer than normal to solve the issue, Prof. Damith should be quite cool about it. The focus here is on learning and developing good coding habits. 

## Overall Comment
I think this module is really good in the sense that you are working on real production codes that are used by Prof. Damith, primarily for CS2103/T. The experience was generally positive. I learned a lot from the features that I worked on.

You are expected to produce consistent work throughout the semester. This can be a little stressful. However, just like I previously mentioned, you have to keep track of your work progress. As long as you spend decent amount of time on the project each week, if should be fine.

## CS3282
Unlike the CS3216 and CS3217 pair, you are automatically granted access to CS3282 when you finish CS3281. CS3281 and CS3282 are only offered in Sem 2, meaning that you must at least take a break of 1 semester in between the 2 modules. You can also choose to take a 3 semesters break if you are not graduating. 

In CS3282, you can work on external OSS projects. Similar to CS3281, you need to document down the work as well. You will be managing the students taking CS3281. This includes reviewing PRs, helping junior developers, handling releases. You also need to give 2 talks on some SWE area that you want to be good at. Languages, frameworks or tool are some of the examples you can say during the talk. I won't go into the details because I think it is not very important here and I have not taken it personally.

## Tips
2 of my teammates took an independent module during the previous summer break before to work on the project. I believe this gave them a really good advantage over other applicants. If you are interested, you should do this to boost your chance of getting into CS3281.

I started working on the project after applying. I remember prof Damith gave around 2-3 weeks after the application for you to work on the project and add supplementary work. Since I did not really have anything to do during the winter break, I pushed out 4 PRs in a week. I think that might have impressed him. Only 1 guy came in totally new to the project.

I will say that knowing web development helps a lot for this module since all of the project involve web development. But of course, you can work on the backend as well.

# CS3217 or CS3281?
**Disclaimer: This is just my personal view!!!**

## CS3217
If you do not have a Mac and are not thinking about getting one, do not even think about CS3217. Note that the mac should be powerful enough for Xcode. Any Apple Silicon Macs will do the job. As for the old intel ones, it depends. Do your research and testing ahead. However, if you are ok with the speed when loading MacOS on windows, you can still continue. Do it at your own risk. Again, do your research and testing ahead.

I took CS3217 because I want to force myself to learn swift and try mobile development. Although our prof said that this is not an iPad module, I think an interest in iOS development is needed. You also get to borrow an iPad from SoC. How cool is that. I got the iPad Air 4 which was really good.

For CS students, do not that to complete your SWE requirement, you will need to complete CS3216 as well. I have not taken it but from what my senior say, it seems like CS3216 focus very little on the code itself. The focus is on UI/UX design and marketing. You are good as long as it works and looks good. This is completely different From CS3217. In CS3217, Prof will grill you if you did not code properly... I do not think I will enjoy CS3216 so I do not plan to take it. I have CS3282 to complete my SWE requirement so nothing to worry there.

## CS3281
I think this is the module that anyone can take. You get to work on things that you are interested in. No hard rules on what you can do. No strict expectations on what to deliver. You can explore whatever you want. But at the end of the week, make sure you have something to record down and share with prof.

Do note that CS3281 is A LOT harder to get in. I must admit that I got lucky. My CAP is probably the lowest in the team at least. But then again, CAP is not the only thing here. Prof looks at the compatibility with the projects. Try to work on showing that. Your CS2103/T result might play some part here as well.

## Conclusion
I have learned a lot from both modules. Both are hard and time consuming. Do be physically and mentally prepared. Do I recommend taking both at the same time? NO. However, I must say that it is completely doable. It might not be as hard as you think.
